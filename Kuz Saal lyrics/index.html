                Lyrics of "Kuz Saal" by Arjan Dhillon go here...<br>
                Pehla Pehar Umran Da Kha Leya Padhaiyan Ne
Dooja Pehar Umran Da Kha Laya Kamaiyan Ne
Do Pehar Tere Layi Sambhe Ne
Dil Da Dard Sunone Nu

Kuz Saal Main Paase Rakh Laye Ne
Tere Naal Bitone Nu Bitone Nu
Kuz Saal Main Paase Rakh Laye Ne
Tere Naal Bitone Nu Bitone Nu

Haye Door Baitheyan Da Hunda
Rusna Manona Kahda
Kaul Hoiye Fer Gall Hor Ae
Sahaan Wargeyan Bina
Hunda Ae Jiyona Kahda
Kaul Hoiye Fer Gall Hor Ae

Haye Akhan Naal Gallan Karan Lai
Naale Gall Tenu Laone Nu

Kuz Saal Main Paase Rakh Laye Ne
Tere Naal Bitone Nu Bitone Nu
Kuz Saal Main Paase Rakh Laye Ne
Tere Naal Bitone Nu Bitone Nu

Haye Haje Asi Haath Tera Fadd Ke Ae Turna
Modde Utte Sir Vi Ae Rakhna
Haye Asi Kina Chahonde Tainu
Tu Kina Chahonda Sanu
Puchhna Ay Nale Tainu Dasna

Sanu Satt Janma Da Saath Mile
Tenu Rajj Rajj Chahone Nu
Kuz Saal Main Paase Rakh Laye Ne
Tere Naal Bitone Nu Bitone Nu
Kuz Saal Main Paase Rakh Laye Ne
Tere Naal Bitone Nu Bitone Nu
